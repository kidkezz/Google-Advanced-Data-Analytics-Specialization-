 # Data Preparation and Cleaning - Summary of Jupyter Notebooks

## 1. Discover What is in Your Dataset
- **Objective:** Understand the datasetâ€™s structure, identify key variables, and detect initial inconsistencies.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Load the dataset and inspect its contents.
  - Identify categorical and numerical variables.
  - Detect missing values and potential outliers.
  - Generate summary statistics and visualizations for data exploration.
  - Examine correlations between numerical variables.
- **Libraries Used:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn`

## 2. Validate and Clean Your Data
- **Objective:** Ensure data accuracy and reliability by handling inconsistencies and errors.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Check for duplicate records and remove them.
  - Validate data types and convert them as needed.
  - Standardize categorical values for consistency.
  - Detect and correct incorrect or outlier values using visualization techniques.
  - Apply transformations and scaling for improved data consistency.
- **Libraries Used:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `scipy.stats`

## 3. Address Missing Data
- **Objective:** Handle missing values strategically to maintain data integrity.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Identify and analyze missing data patterns using visualization techniques.
  - Compare different imputation techniques (mean, median, mode, interpolation, forward/backward fill).
  - Evaluate the impact of missing data treatment on analysis by comparing distributions before and after imputation.
- **Libraries Used:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `missingno`

### Summary
This project focuses on the essential steps for preparing and cleaning datasets, including exploration, validation, and handling missing values. These techniques ensure that data is ready for accurate analysis and modeling. Additionally, visualization techniques are heavily utilized to understand patterns, detect anomalies, and assess the effectiveness of cleaning and imputation methods.
