  - Visualize relationships using scatter plots.
  - Fit a simple linear regression model.
  - Interpret model coefficients and predictions.
- **Libraries Used:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`

## 2. Evaluate Simple Linear Regression
- **Objective:** Assess the performance of the simple linear regression model.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Calculate model accuracy using R-squared and mean squared error.
  - Check residuals for normality and homoscedasticity.
  - Interpret model performance.
- **Libraries Used:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`

## 3. Perform Multiple Linear Regression
- **Objective:** Extend regression analysis by incorporating multiple predictor variables.
