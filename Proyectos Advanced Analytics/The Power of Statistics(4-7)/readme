# Air Quality Analysis - Summary of Jupyter Notebooks

## 1. Explore Descriptive Statistics
- **Objective:** Use descriptive statistics to analyze air quality data with respect to carbon monoxide.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Calculate measures of central tendency and dispersion.
  - Load and process data from a CSV file.
  - Summarize key statistics for stakeholder insights.
- **Libraries Used:** `pandas`, `numpy`

## 2. Explore Probability Distributions
- **Objective:** Identify probability distributions, calculate z-scores, and detect outliers in air quality data.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Determine the best-fitting probability distribution for the data.
  - Compute z-scores for individual observations.
  - Identify and interpret outliers.
- **Libraries Used:** `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `statsmodels.api`, `scipy`

## 3. Explore Sampling
- **Objective:** Apply sampling techniques to improve analysis efficiency on large datasets.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Select representative samples from the air quality dataset.
  - Implement different sampling techniques.
  - Analyze the impact of sampling on data analysis.
- **Libraries Used:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`, `scipy`

## 4. Explore Confidence Intervals
- **Objective:** Analyze air quality in different U.S. states and determine which states may be affected by a new federal policy.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Summarize mean AQI for relevant states.
  - Create a boxplot visualization of AQI using `seaborn`.
  - Identify states that may be impacted by the policy.
  - Construct a confidence interval for the state with the highest mean AQI.
- **Libraries Used:** `pandas`, `numpy`

## 5. Explore Hypothesis Testing
- **Objective:** Conduct hypothesis testing to analyze air quality differences across regions.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Compare AQI between Los Angeles County and the rest of California.
  - Determine whether New York has a lower AQI than Ohio.
  - Assess whether Michigan's mean AQI meets a policy threshold.
- **Methods Used:** Two-sample t-tests (Welchâ€™s t-test, `scipy.stats.ttest_ind(equal_var=False)`).
- **Libraries Used:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy.stats`

### Summary
This project involves statistical analysis of air quality data, including confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, probability distributions, and sampling techniques. The insights gained can be used for policy recommendations and environmental strategies.
